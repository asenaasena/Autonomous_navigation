**MUEAVI Calibration Info**

MUEAVI_TF includes all 8 sensor points calibrated tf data by using ICP algorithm. 

The HD map was transformed to local coordinate system (Map Translation in the sheet) and calibrated TF is local coordinate system. 

Therefore, in order to convert back to OSGB (which is original coordinate system of HD Map), you can refer to hd_map_align in sheet2
